'''
The game() function in a program lets a user play a game and returns the score 
as an integer. You need to read a file â€˜Hi-score.txtâ€™ which is either blank or 
contains the previous Hi-score. You need to write a program to update the Hiscore whenever the game() function breaks the Hi-score.
