# Copilot Instructions for Python-Daily-practice

## Project Overview
This repository is a collection of daily Python practice scripts, organized by topic and concept. Each folder contains standalone `.py` files focused on a specific area of Python, such as variables, operators, type casting, strings, lists, tuples, and practice problems.

## Directory Structure
- `01Introduction,Comment,Module/` — Introductory concepts, comments, and modules
- `02Variable and Datatypes/` — Variables and data types
- `03Operator/` — Operators
- `04TypeCasting/` — Type casting
- `05Input()/` — Input handling
- `06String/` — String operations
- `07EscapeCharacter/` — Escape characters
- `08List And Tuple/` — Lists and tuples
- `Practice Set 1/2/3/` — Practice problems for review

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- Each script is self-contained and does not import from other files in the repo.
- Practice sets (`Practice Set 1/2/3/`) contain numbered problems for hands-on coding.
- Naming follows the topic or problem number for easy navigation.
- No external dependencies or package management; all scripts use standard Python libraries.
- No test framework or build system is present; scripts are run directly with Python.

## Developer Workflow
- Run any script using: `python <path-to-script>`
  - Example: `python 08List And Tuple/list.py`
- No setup required; works with any standard Python 3.x interpreter.
- No environment variables or configuration files are needed.

## Integration Points
- No external APIs, databases, or services are integrated.
- No cross-file imports or shared state; each file is independent.

## Example Patterns
- List manipulation: See `08List And Tuple/list.py`
- Practice problems: See `Practice Set 1/problem1.py`, etc.
- Basic input/output: See `05Input()/input.py`

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Focus on generating clear, beginner-friendly Python code for each topic.
- When adding new scripts, follow the existing folder and naming conventions.
- Avoid introducing external dependencies or complex architectures.
- Reference existing files for examples of style and structure.
